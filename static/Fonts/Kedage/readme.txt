The Indian Language Technology Solutions Project is pleased to announce the availability of two more Kannada opentype fonts named "Kedage" and "Mallige" by next month.We would be happy to e-mail beta copies of the fonts on request.
While Mallige is a handwritten font Kedage is a regular font with much better glyphs compared to Sampige font.
We are in the process of fixing few errors identified with Sampige while using on Java platform and would be happy if any of you would volunteer to fix the same.
We thank all the users of Sampige font and wish them much better kannada computing using the new fonts to be released on the following website http://brahmi.sourceforge.net
