### *Why does the nukta not work in Microsoft Word?*

The nukta (either U+1133B or U+1133C) does not work in all cases with Microsoft DirectWrite,
which is what is used for text shaping in Microsoft Word (and other Microsoft applications),
as well as Windows itself.

See https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/typography-issues/issues/738 for more details.
